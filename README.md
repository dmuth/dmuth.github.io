This repo holds the source for my website [All About Cheetahs](http://www.AllAboutCheetahs.info/).

Site generation is done with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is an amazing static site generator.  You should check it out!


## Site Development

- Run `jekyll server`
- Go to <a href="http://localhost:4000/">http://localhost:4000/</a> in your web browser
- Edit or create any files in `_posts/` and the local copy of the site will be updated automatically.
- Commit and push the changes up to GitHub.  The live site should udpate within a few seconds.
