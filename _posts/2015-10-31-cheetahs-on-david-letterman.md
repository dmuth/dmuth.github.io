A cheetah once made an appearance on Daivd Letterman's show and sat on his desk!

The amazingly awesome Jack Hanna then goes on to explain how the Anatolian Shephard
dogs are used to guard livestock, which scares cheetahs away from livestocl and
keeps them from being killed by farmers.

It's a very educational video and worth a watch!
