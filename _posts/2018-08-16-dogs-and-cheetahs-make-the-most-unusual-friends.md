At the San Diego Zoo, cheetahs are paired with the dogs.  This is because cheetahs
are very non-agressive.  In fact, they are the "scaredy-cats" of all the big cats.
The dog is used to reassure the cheetah that there's nothing to get worked up about 
and that everything is okay.

Could a cheetah win against a dog in a fight?  Let us know in the comments!
